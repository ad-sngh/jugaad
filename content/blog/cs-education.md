Over the course of my career I have self-taught myself a number of topics. 

* Scripting (R, SQL, Python, etc.)
* Machine Learning (Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, etc.)
* Data Science (Data Wrangling, Data Analysis, etc.)
* AI (Deep Learning, etc.)
* Virtualization (Docker, etc.)
* Basic Linux & Shell commands

But I never received a formal education in Computer Science. And has always bugged me when I would see friends and colleagues with a CS education just grasp concepts which took me a couple of minutes to understand. 

The first resource that I came across which tackled this problem head on was a course designed at MIT to help noobs like me level up, [The Missing Semester of my CS Education](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/).
