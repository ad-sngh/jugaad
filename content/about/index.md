# Hello, I'm Aditya! 👋

Welcome to my personal corner of the internet. I'm a data scientist first, who has evolved his skills from data science to ML Engineering to AI and now to Agent based AI workflows. I currently lead the team that builds cloud native AI solutions over at Wiser. I also am a participant on the AI steering committee at Wiser which is committed to making AI more accessible to folks at the organization. 

Now I see myself as a leader on the intersection of AI and software development, and am excited to see where this journey leads me to.

In a previous life I have also built the pricing & promotions solutions over at Loblaw Companies Ltd. and have built data solutions for industry leading orgs such as Target, Kinaxis and more.

## What I Do

I specialize in building robust and scalable software solutions powered by AI & Machine Learning. My interests include:

- Cloud Computing
- Machine Learning
- AI Based Workflows
- Software Development
- Food
- Manchester United

.. in no particular order.

## Why This Website?

This website is a place where I will share my thoughts, experiences and insights as an individual who has seen the transformation of the data space from standalone analysis to notebooks to automated solutions to now full fledged AI workflows. As I lead teams and cultures to adopt modern solutions to help enhance traditional workflows, I will share my experiences, challenges, learnings and insights here. 

I am not a developer by trade, but I have always been fascinated by the power of software and how it can transform the way we live and work. I am a firm believer that AI and Machine Learning are the future of software development and I am excited to see where this journey leads me.

I am also a firm believer that the best way to learn is by doing, and this artifact on the internet will be a collection of my mistakes & learnings on this journey.
